# Need-A-Bus
In the day to day life inside Dhaka, a lot of us face the problem of finding the right local bus and route to 
reach our desired destination as it is the cheapest and fastest way possible to travel inside the city. In 
order to solve this difficulty of the mass, our team has the ultimate solution – “Need A Bus”.

Features : 
The main features of our proposed program are as follows:
1) User will be able to see the available bus by entering location. For example, if someone is at Mirpur 
and wants to go Bashundhara our program will show the available buses from Mirpur. 
2) The cost for travel will also be shown to the user. Some local buses need ticket bookings, the address 
and number of the nearest counter from the user will be shown to the user
3) An estimated time to reach the desired destination through any of the available bus will also be 
shown to the user.
4) Distance of his/her destination will be shown to the user( in kilometers)
5) The user can contact us directly through provided email in case of any trouble regarding the use of 
our program.
6) By using our program, the user will be able to get the correct information about the available local 
buses from any place inside Dhaka city. This will save time, reduce harassments and ensure a safe 
journey. 
In a crowded city like Dhaka people often pick the wrong transport which cost their time. And the 
people who are new in the city or not well-known about the routes, they suffer a lot from this problem. 
Our program will be a time saver and a journey assist.
